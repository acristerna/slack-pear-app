# Pear 

Meet Pear, a simple pair programming Slack app that allows you to share your wins, goals, and challenges or create random pairs for your weekly pairings. 

Pear is built on the [Slack Platform](https://api.slack.com) with Slack's [Bolt Javascript](https://slack.dev/bolt-js/tutorial/getting-started) framework. 

If you want to see the app in action, there's some screenshots below, or you can clone the repo and run it locally.
